"""Per-session event-driven state machine.

This module gathers the various "who owns the current turn" signals previously
scattered across ``LLMSessionManager`` / ``OmniOfflineClient``
(``current_speech_id`` rotation, ``session._is_responding``,
``_proactive_expected_sid`` contextvar, ``last_user_activity_time``) into a
single-point state machine. Goals:

1. The proactive-chat pipeline's phase1/phase2 can poll
   ``is_proactive_preempted(claim_token)`` at **zero cost** (O(1) read, no lock)
   — even checking between every LLM chunk introduces no observable overhead.
2. Signals like "user takes over" / "AI starts replying" are published as
   events; consumers (TTS worker, logging, frontend sync) can subscribe instead
   of reading multiple fields directly.
3. Independent per-catgirl instances (extensible to per-catgirl+user later),
   with no state interference between them.

Introduced in Stage 1 as a facade: event emission points sit at the existing
sid rotation / proactive lifecycle spots, the old fields
(``current_speech_id`` / ``_is_responding``) remain, and consumers migrate
incrementally (see Stage 2).
